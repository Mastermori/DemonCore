# DemonCore
This processor was developed as part of the Embedded Systems Project at Uni Hamburg.
It contains:
* VHDL code describing the hardware of the processor
* a lark grammar describing our own assembler language (demon assembler)
* a parser/compiler for that assembler language
* a language server + VS Code extionsion for language specific auto-completion/syntax highlighting and more (for the assembler language).
It was developed in one term and was inspired heavily by the RISC-V architecture.
